### Readme for the utils

The `data_processing.py` is a misc with some functions to convert the trajectories to and from ARDL typical .json format

The other two folders contain the functions for pre-training eigenvalue converter and success rate predictor, in case if you would like some examples of how to do it from scratch. Please note that pre-trained versions of these models are already included in the master folder named `model_0_50k_epochs.pth` and `model_0_SR.pth` correspondingly.
There are some training data provided for both pre-trainings, they are more of an example, than the exact same as in the paper (due to space constraints), please don't forget to unpack the archives before running the codes.

### Prerequisites
You might additionally need <code> re, matplotlib, and json </code> packages to run the contents of this directory. That is in addition to prerequisites in the master directory.
